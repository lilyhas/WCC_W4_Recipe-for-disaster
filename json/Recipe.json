  "text": "There are two little tips that make all the difference when preparing the pastitsio pasta. Firstly, boil the pasta for the pastitsio 2-3 minutes less than the package instructions.Â Your pasta will also cook when the dish is baked in the oven, so if you cook them fully on their own they will turn out mushy! Secondly mix the boiled pasta with crumbled feta cheese and a the whites from two eggs. The feta cheese will give your pasta a delicious tang while the egg whites will help the pasta stay together when your pastitsio is cut!"
